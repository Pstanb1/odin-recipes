This is my first html project. In this project I aim to create a basic blog site with links to recicpes. This should showcase (and allow me to practise the new skills I have learnt)

This should include:
-Setting up my root folder and files for other pages beyond the home page
-Setting up my html boilerpate 
-Using bold and italicised text
-Linking other we pages (both absolute and regular)
-Embedding images

I will return to this project in the future to improve it with a CSS file.
