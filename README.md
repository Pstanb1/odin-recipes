This is my first html project. In this project, I aim to create a basic blog site with links to recipes. This should showcase (and allow me to practise(!) the new skills I have learnt)

This should include:
-Setting up my directory

-Practise html boilerpate

-Using bold and italicised text

-Linking other web pages (both absolute and regular)

-Using ordered and unordered lists

-Embedding images

It hasn't been too challenging so far but I'm sure it will get a lot trickier!

I will return to this project in the future to improve it with CSS.
