        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>The full Irish breakfast was created for farm workers so they would be satiated and ready for a full day's work. The meal was made up of local produce and homemade items, all of which were cooked in a frying pan with a pad of Irish butter. Today the list of foods that make up a full Irish (as it is called) has expanded, and it may not be eaten at the start of a busy workday, but the tradition continues.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Rashers</em> of back bacon</li>
            <li>Sausages</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Black pudding</li>
            <li>White pudding</li>
            <li>Baked beans</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Hash browns</li>
            <li>Brown <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/irish-soda-bread">(soda)</a> bread</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat and melt a knob of good Irish creamery butter. Add the rashers and fry them until they are cooked to your liking (irish style cooked but not crispy). Set aside on a warmed plate in the oven to keep warm and fry the sausages in the frying pan. Once cooked add them to the rashers on the warmed plate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile slice the puddings, half the tomatoes and chop up the mushrooms and add to the frying pan, frying until they are browned on all sides. Again, once finished add to a warmed plate in the oven. While you are frying the puddings, mushrooms and tomatoes, on a separate saucepan on another hob you can heat the baked beans if using.</li>
            <li>If going the traditional route and using potato bread or indeed using cold cooked potatoes add it to the frying pan and cook as to your preference.</li>
            <li>After finishing with the vegetables and puddings one can next fry the eggs in the same frying pan. Once finished with the eggs, one can now add all the cooked ingredients together and serve on 4 plates.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And there you are! All ready to enjoy the emerald ilse or you may have begun to work your way out a Guinnes enduced coma. Either way, wash down with a strong cup of Breakfast tea be it Barrys or Lyons tea depending on your local ties. A healthy side glass of orange juice is optional</p>
